
 Step 1: Understanding the Challenge
- Read the challenge's description carefully to understand what is expected to do. 

Step 2: Downloading the APK
- Download the APK from the hackthebox platform. Ensure that we have the right permissions.

Step 3: Decompiling the APK
- Used tools like APKTool (https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/), jadx to decompile the APK.
- steps to decompile with APKTool:
  1. Install APKTool.
  2. Open a command line and run `apktool d filename.apk -o output_dir`.
  3. Navigate to `output_dir` to view the decompiled contents.

Step 4: Inspecting Decompiled Code
- Explore the decompiled code:
  - AndroidManifest.xml: This file contains information about the app's structure, permissions, and activities.
  - Res directory: Contains resources like images, layouts, and XML files.
  - smali code: Represents the Android bytecode, which you can analyze to understand the app's behavior.

Step 5: Identifying Interesting Components
- Looked for suspicious activity, such as:
  - Custom permissions or permissions that don't seem necessary for the app's function.
  - Code snippets referencing sensitive actions, like accessing system files or network connections.
  - Hidden activities or components not mentioned in the manifest.
  
Step 6: Using an Android Emulator
- Load the APK into an Android emulator, such as Genymotion(https://www.genymotion.com/) / Android Studio's (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
  1. Install the APK onto the emulator.
  2. Use the app to interact with its features.
  3. Observe the app's behavior, logging, and responses to different inputs.

Step 7: Debugging with a Dynamic Analysis Tool
- Use tools like Xposed Framework (https://repo.xposed.info/) to dynamically analyze the app at runtime.
- With Xposed, you can hook into app functions to observe or manipulate them.

Step 8: Document Your Findings
- Kept track of interesting points, code snippets, or vulnerabilities found during the analysis.

Step 9: Exploring Further
  - Tried to review online resources, including forums, blogs, or videos, for insights on similar challenges.
  - Experiment with different tools or techniques, like static or dynamic analysis.
